### abstractClass
Abstract class in PHP refers to class which contains at least one abstract method. It is a special type of class which cannot be instantiated and serves as a base class for other classes which can inherit from it.
An abstract method is simply a method definition which is not created and includes only the function prototype. This allows the derived classes to implement their own version of the abstract methods without creating any conflict with the parent class.
